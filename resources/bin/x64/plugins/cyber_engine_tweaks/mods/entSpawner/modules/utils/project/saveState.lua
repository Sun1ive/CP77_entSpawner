---every node so a re-check only costs the part of the tree that actually changed.
---
---Two ideas carry the whole module:
---
---1. **A rope, not a string.** Each node caches `pieces`, a flat list whose entries are either literal
---   JSON fragments or nested `pieces` tables belonging to children. Concatenating a node's full JSON
---   into its cache would cost O(total bytes x depth); the rope costs O(total bytes) once, and the
---   finished document is never materialised at all -- the writer streams the rope into the file.
---
---2. **A Merkle content hash.** A node's hash is derived from its own fields plus its children's
---   hashes, so the root hash changes if and only if something below it changed. Answering "is this
---   project modified?" therefore never costs more than rebuilding the invalidated chain.
---
---The hash deliberately ignores editor-only state (see `VOLATILE_KEYS`), so clicking a row or folding
---the hierarchy does not make a project look modified.
